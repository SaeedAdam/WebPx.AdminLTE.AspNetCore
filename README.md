AdminLTE 3 Template Razor Class Libraries for ASP.NET Core

Based on AdminLTE 3 Template by https://adminlte.io/, we decided to provide a ready to run versiÃ³n adapted to ASP.NET Core Razor Pages

ColorLib's Html Template Live Demo: https://adminlte.io/themes/dev/AdminLTE/index.html

WebPx Live Demo: [Demo.AdminLTE3.WebPx.com](https://demo.adminlte3.webpx.com)

# Features
- Razor Class Library with Views required to function the template
- Split in Views so that it allows to replace one or more parts for the whole site, any area or folder
- Configuration for adjusting which features you wan't to be called.
- SideBar collapsible and persistent for the user
- Layout includes various sections for extensibility
    - Header, for links and metadata
    - ThemeLinks, for replacing links to AdminLTE3 CSS files
    - PageEnd, for extra html at the end of the page, before scripts
    - Scripts, for additional javascript files/blocks
- NEW! Two Libraries with Static Content:
    - WebPx.AdminLTE.AspNetCore.Statics contains all the files that the template includes (js, dist, plugins and Admin LTE Theme)
    - WebPxAdminLTE.AspNetCore.Statics.Shared contains the pictures and scripts included in the original theme for displaying demo daa
- NEW! Breaking Change: Views have been changed from /Pages/Shared/AdminLTE3 to /Views/Shared/AdminLTE3 so that it can be shared between MVC and Razor Pages.

# Folder Structure

The Template includes the Layout File (*_Layout*), and various Partial Views that you can replace to adjust your application. NEW! For flexibility in area development you can also change this files in the corresponding /Area/[AreaName]/Views/Shared/AdminLTE3 folder so that customization applies per area.
